This work has been done for the purpose of doing my final year project under supervion of Prof Matthew Huntbach at Queen Mary University of London.
I am happy about distribution of my project if and only if it is for academic use with including changes.

In order to run the game, just click on the MSci-Project.jar file in the MSci-Project folder after unzipping the submitted file. This project best runs in a Mac operating system. So, it is kindly asked that run it through that OS, and as well, have your Java Machine updated to a version released before the end of April 2019. Again, in the report, this information can be found. It is better to mention that despite being aware of ‘’the extension of the ReadMe file should be .md as GitHub prefers it’’, but only for your convenience, it has been made with .txt.

Thank you for your consideration.
