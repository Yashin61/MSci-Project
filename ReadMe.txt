YASHIN'S CHECKERS GAME

Checkers is played on a standard 64-square board of two 32 different colours. Each player has 12 pieces (stones) in different colours than the opponent's ones. The players' pieces only stay in the same coloured-squares throughout the game. The objective of the game is to capture the opponentâ€™s stones as much as possible, but in a clever way. Think of supporting your front stones, avoiding them being captured by the other player. But, sometimes you may need to sacrify some. The capturing is done when a stone has an empty diagonal square behind, and stays adjacent to the opponet's one. So, the opponent can capture it by jumping over and reaching to that empty square.
When a stone reaches to the edge in the other side of the board, it turns to a king piece. It is possible to have more than one king.
All movements are forward diagonal in one square length, except for a king which is able to do it in backwards as well.
Doing a possible capture right after capturing one is not allowed, again except for a king.
Finally, the winner will be the one whose opponent does not have any stones left to play or does not have any legal movements to do.
